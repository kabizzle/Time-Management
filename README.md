# Time Management Project

## Final Programming Project for CS-A1123 Basics in Programming Y2 (Spring 2022)

# Introduction

My project is a Time Management app. I have built a graphical interface where a user can add activities and track the time spent on them. 

## File and directory structure

This project has two main directories, "Code" and "Documents".

Inside "Code" is the "src" directory, which contains all of the source code for the project.

Inside "Documents" is the origin plan for the project (written before the project began) and the project's documentation.

## Installation instructions

The program required PyQt5 to be installed.

## User instructions

  - How is the program executed
  
The program is executed by navigating to ./Code/src and running main.py
e.g. "python main.py"

This will launch the graphical user interface, and the rest of the execution will take place within the interface.
