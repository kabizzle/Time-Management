## Checkpoint 1 

## Current properties

I have implemented two different classes so far: Activity and Time. The user can track the time for one activity. 

- The program will first print the starting time. 
- When the command is entered to stop, the program will print the ending time and the total time spent on the activity.
- The program will then terminate. 

## Instructions

### Is it possible to run the program already?

Yes, a user can run the program to track the time for one activity.

### How is the program executed?

The program can be executed by:
- Navigating to the folder 'Code\src' in a terminal and running 'python main.py'.
- Inputting a name for the activity
- Inputting 'stop' when you want to stop tracking time
