## Checkpoint 2

## Current properties

I have written four different classes so far: Activity, Time, FileData and GUI. I am currently working on the GUI, so the previous functionality has been altered: the time for an activity cannot be tracked. 

## Instructions

### Is it possible to run the program already?

No. When the program is run, the GUI is displayed, but it does not work yet.

### How is the program executed?
! The program does not work yet, but once the gui is configured, it can be executed by:
- Navigating to the folder 'Code\src' in a terminal and running 'python main.py'.
 
## Schedule

### How much time have you spent making the project this far?

I have spent roughly 18 hours on this project so far.

### Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?

Yes, I will work on the GUI over the course of the next week, instead of it being completed by today (15.04.2022). However, I believe the final program should be completed in time for my projected end date: 3.05.2022.

## Other

### Have you faced any specific problems?

Yes, I ran into a couple problems so far:

- Building the GUI
I started building the gui by following the template  from RobotWorld, but after learning more about PyQt5, I changed the format a bit. 

Also, I think my code wasn't "Object Oriented" enough, so I will need to revisit my Classes and Methods to better integrate with the GUI elements. 

- Time display and tracking
I initially wrote the program using the DateTime module and I was simply tracking time, not displaying it. However, now that I need to display the time in the GUI, I may have to reevaluate this choice.
