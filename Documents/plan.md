## General Description and Difficulty Level

I will be building a program that allows users to time their activities, for example when studying for different courses. 

I will be attempting the Medium difficulty for this project. This will include a graphical interface, having distinct activities (i.e. time can only be measured for one activity at a time) and unittesting for part of the program.

## Use case description and draft of the user interface

The user will interact with the program through a Graphical User Interface. The user will be able to create activities using a text field, select an activity from a checklist and start/stop the timer using a button. The program will print its messages in the gui. 

# Graphic Interface

The program window will display:
- a list of all the user's created activities 
- a text box and button for the user to create a new activity
- a button to start and stop the timer
